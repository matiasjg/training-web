This is a simple ReactJS project to login and display training API data (Rails API)

We are using:

- Node 4.2.6
- Axios 0.18.0
- Redux 4.0
- React-Redux 5.0.7
- Redux-Thunk 2.2
- React-bootstrap 0.3

Theme:
- Bootstrap 3
- Customization: https://bootswatch.com/united/


Sessions: I am using sessionStorage to keep the logged in user.
Database: I made a REST Rails APP to get and save the information.

* TODO: *
- Add the feature to change the training status.
- Move some common functions like filter plan or filter training from the store.plans/store.trainings to a common lib file.
